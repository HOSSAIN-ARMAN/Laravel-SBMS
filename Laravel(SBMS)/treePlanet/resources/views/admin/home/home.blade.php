                with a profit margin. Currently they are managing their business manually, for that reason
                ABC Company is suffering to manage their stocks and sale management information, also the
                purchase informationâ€™s on their products as they needed more time to summarize the result.

                able to manage their products, purchases, stocks and sales, with which they could have right
                data on time and with less effort.
